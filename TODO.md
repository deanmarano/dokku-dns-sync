## Phase 3: Testing & CI Infrastructure - COMPLETED ✅

- [x] **Docker integration tests** - Full containerized testing with real Dokku ✅
- [x] **GitHub Actions workflows** - Both unit tests and integration tests ✅
- [x] **Pre-commit hooks** - Shellcheck linting and optional testing ✅
- [x] **Branch rename** - Updated from master to main ✅
- [x] **Test optimization** - Pre-generated SSH keys for faster testing ✅

## Phase 4: Core Plugin Functionality - WORKING PERFECTLY! ✅

**Test Results from duodeca.local (2025-08-04):**
- [x] **DNS provider auto-detection** - Correctly detects AWS credentials ✅
- [x] **Plugin installation** - Seamless installation from git repository ✅
- [x] **Domain discovery** - Automatically finds all app domains ✅
- [x] **Hosted zone detection** - Finds correct AWS Route53 hosted zones ✅
- [x] **DNS record creation** - Successfully creates A records ✅
- [x] **Status reporting** - Beautiful table formatting with emojis ✅
- [x] **App lifecycle management** - Add/remove apps from DNS tracking ✅
- [x] **Error handling** - Graceful handling of missing hosted zones ✅

## Phase 5: Plugin Building Best Practices (Medium Priority) - COMPLETED ✅

Based on [Dokku Plugin Building Tips](https://dokku.com/docs/development/plugin-creation/#plugin-building-tips):

- [x] **Verify plugin.toml completeness** - Enhanced description and bumped version to 0.3.0 ✅
- [x] **Audit file permissions** - Made config executable, all other plugin files already executable ✅
- [x] **Implement consistent pipefail usage** - Already implemented in all scripts ✅
- [x] **Add trace mode support** - Already implemented in all subcommands ✅
- [x] **Verify dependency checking** - Already using `command -v` for aws-cli validation ✅
- [x] **Enhance help command functionality** - Proper columnar output and formatting working ✅
- [x] **Review command namespacing** - Using 'dns' namespace, no conflicts with core plugins ✅
- [x] **Implement catch-all command** - Already implemented with `DOKKU_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_EXIT` ✅
- [x] **Use config helpers properly** - No config operations needed (DNS is stateless) ✅
- [x] **Expose functions file** - Added documentation and public API comments ✅
- [x] **Use app image helpers** - Not applicable (DNS plugin doesn't manage containers) ✅
- [x] **Replace docker calls** - No direct docker calls found ✅
- [x] **Add container labels** - Not applicable (DNS plugin doesn't create containers) ✅
- [x] **Use copy_from_image helper** - Not applicable (DNS plugin doesn't copy from images) ✅
- [x] **Avoid direct dokku calls** - Using proper domains plugin API where needed ✅

## Phase 6: Feature Enhancement (Low Priority)

- [x] **Clean up help output** - Solidified simplified API design ✅
- [ ] **Add support for multiple DNS record types** - CNAME, MX, TXT records
- [ ] **Implement domain validation** - Validate domains before DNS changes
- [ ] **Add DNS record backup/restore** - Safety features for DNS changes
- [ ] **Create DNS health monitoring** - Periodic DNS record validation
- [ ] **Create Cloudflare backend** - Second provider integration

## Notes

**Major API Simplification**: The plugin has been completely redesigned from a service-based architecture to a global configuration approach. This eliminates the confusing two-step process and makes DNS work more intuitively with Dokku apps.

## Test Results Summary

The DNS plugin is **production ready**! Real-world testing on duodeca.local shows:

✅ **Perfect AWS Integration** - Auto-detects credentials, finds hosted zones, creates records  
✅ **Beautiful UX** - Clear status tables with emojis and helpful messaging  
✅ **Robust Error Handling** - Gracefully handles missing hosted zones and edge cases  
✅ **Domain Management** - Seamlessly tracks multiple domains per app  
✅ **CI/CD Ready** - Full GitHub Actions workflows and pre-commit hooks  

### API Success Highlights

The **simplified API** works exactly as designed:
- `dns:configure aws` → Auto-detects existing AWS credentials  
- `dns:add nextcloud` → Discovers all app domains automatically  
- `dns:sync nextcloud` → Creates DNS records (nextcloud.deanoftech.com ✅)
- `dns:report nextcloud` → Beautiful status table with hosted zone info

### Current API (Battle-Tested)

```bash
# Core commands - ALL WORKING PERFECTLY ✅
dokku dns:configure [provider]                     # Configure DNS provider (auto-detects AWS) ✅
dokku dns:verify                                   # Verify provider connectivity ✅
dokku dns:add <app>                                # Add app domains to DNS management ✅
dokku dns:sync <app>                               # Create/update DNS records ✅
dokku dns:report [app]                             # Beautiful status tables with emojis ✅
dokku dns:remove <app>                             # Remove app from DNS tracking ✅

# Helper commands
dokku dns:help                                     # Show all available commands ✅
```

### Workflow Example

```bash
# One-time setup
dokku dns:configure aws
dokku dns:provider-auth

# Use with any app (domains are automatically discovered)
dokku domains:add myapp example.com
dokku dns:sync myapp

# Check status
dokku dns:report myapp

# Change provider later if needed
dokku dns:configure cloudflare
dokku dns:provider-auth
```

The plugin now automatically discovers all domains configured for an app via `dokku domains:report` and creates A records pointing to the server's IP address.
