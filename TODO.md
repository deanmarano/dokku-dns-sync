# DNS Plugin Development TODO

## Current Status

The DNS plugin is **production ready** and fully functional! All core features have been implemented and tested. See [DONE.md](./DONE.md) for completed work.

## Phase 6: Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

- [ ] **Add support for multiple DNS record types** - CNAME, MX, TXT records
- [ ] **Implement domain validation** - Validate domains before DNS changes
- [ ] **Add DNS record backup/restore** - Safety features for DNS changes
- [ ] **Create DNS health monitoring** - Periodic DNS record validation
- [ ] **Create Cloudflare backend** - Second provider integration
- [ ] **Add domain parameter to dns:sync** - Allow syncing specific domains only

## Current Working API

The DNS plugin has a simple, battle-tested API:

```bash
# Core commands - ALL WORKING PERFECTLY ✅
dokku dns:configure [provider]                     # Configure DNS provider
dokku dns:verify                                   # Verify provider connectivity
dokku dns:add <app>                                # Add app domains to DNS management
dokku dns:sync <app>                               # Create/update DNS records
dokku dns:sync-all                                 # Bulk sync all DNS-managed apps
dokku dns:report [app]                             # Beautiful status tables with emojis
dokku dns:remove <app>                             # Remove app from DNS tracking
dokku dns:help                                     # Show all available commands
```

## Recent Achievements

- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline** - Full GitHub Actions workflow with pre-commit hooks
- ✅ **Production testing** - Successfully deployed and tested on real servers
- ✅ **Documentation** - Auto-generated README with comprehensive examples

## Notes

All high-priority features are complete. The plugin is ready for production use with AWS Route53. Future enhancements are nice-to-have features that can be implemented as needed.
