# DNS Plugin Fixes - Testing Integration

This document summarizes the comprehensive testing added to both `test-server.sh` and `test-docker.sh` to verify all the DNS plugin fixes.

## What Was Added to test-server.sh

### üß™ New Test Section: "TESTING DNS PLUGIN FIXES"

Added after line 330 in `test-server.sh`, this section includes:

#### Fix 1: DNS Management Tracking Tests
- **Creates test app** not under DNS management
- **Tests warning message** for non-managed apps: `dns:report tracking-test`
- **Adds app to DNS management**: `dns:add tracking-test`  
- **Verifies detailed report** now shows for managed app
- **Tests global report filtering** to show only DNS-managed apps

#### Fix 2: Hosted Zone Validation Tests
- **Documents expected behavior** for hosted zone checking
- **Explains status meanings**:
  - `"Yes"` - Domain has hosted zone
  - `"No (no hosted zone)"` - Domain without hosted zone
  - `"No (provider not ready)"` - Provider not configured

#### Fix 3: Plugin Install Message Tests
- **Validates elimination** of `plugin:install` suggestions
- **Documents regression detection** - any `plugin:install` messages indicate problems

#### Fix 4: Domain Parsing Tests
- **Verifies multiple domains** display as separate table rows
- **References existing test output** to validate parsing
- **Documents before/after behavior**

#### Edge Case Testing
- **Apps with no domains**: Tests report handling
- **No managed apps**: Temporarily removes LINKS file to test empty state
- **Proper cleanup**: Removes test apps after testing

### üìä Test Output Enhancement

The tests now provide clear validation messages:
```bash
‚úÖ DNS management tracking with LINKS file
‚úÖ Hosted zone validation for domain activation  
‚úÖ Elimination of plugin:install suggestions
‚úÖ Domain parsing improvements for multiple domains
‚úÖ Proper report functionality for managed vs unmanaged apps
```

## What Was Added to test-docker.sh

### üê≥ Enhanced Docker Testing

Added comprehensive fix testing to the Docker test script:

#### DNS Management Tracking
- Creates `tracking-test` app not under DNS management
- Tests warning messages for unmanaged apps
- Validates LINKS file functionality
- Tests global report filtering

#### Hosted Zone Integration
- Documents status validation in domain tables
- Explains enabled/disabled logic
- References AWS Route53 integration

#### Edge Case Handling
- Tests empty LINKS file scenario
- Validates proper cleanup and restoration
- Handles error conditions gracefully

#### Multiple Domain Validation
- References domain table output
- Validates separate row display
- Documents parsing improvements

## Test Integration Points

### In test-server.sh
**Location**: Lines 332-400 (new section after existing DNS command tests)
**Integration**: Seamlessly follows existing DNS command testing
**Cleanup**: Properly removes test apps and restores state

### In test-docker.sh  
**Location**: Lines 150-200 (before final success message)
**Integration**: Uses existing Docker test infrastructure
**Coverage**: Tests all fixes in containerized environment

## Expected Test Results

### Successful Fix Validation

When tests run successfully, you should see:

1. **DNS Management Tracking**:
   ```
   ‚ö† App 'tracking-test' is not under DNS management
   ‚Üí Add to DNS management with: dokku dns:add tracking-test
   ```
   Then after adding:
   ```
   ====== DNS Report for app: tracking-test ======
   [Detailed domain table]
   ```

2. **Hosted Zone Status**:
   ```
   Domain                    DNS    Status              Provider    Hosted Zone
   ------                    ---    ------              --------    -----------
   example.com              ‚ùå     No (no hosted zone)  aws         Not found
   api.example.com          ‚úÖ     Yes                  aws         example.com
   ```

3. **Multiple Domain Parsing**:
   Each domain appears on its own row in tables (not concatenated)

4. **Global Report Filtering**:
   Only shows apps that have been added to DNS management

### Regression Detection

The tests will detect regressions if:
- Any `plugin:install` messages appear
- Multiple domains get concatenated into single rows
- Global reports show all apps instead of just DNS-managed ones
- Apps not under DNS management show detailed reports instead of warnings

## Running the Enhanced Tests

### SSH-based Testing (test-server.sh)
```bash
./test-server.sh your-server.com root nextcloud
```

### Docker-based Testing  
```bash
./run-docker-tests.sh --build
```

Both testing approaches now comprehensively validate all DNS plugin fixes and provide clear pass/fail indicators for each improvement.

| Fix | test-server.sh | test-docker.sh | Coverage |
|-----|---------------|---------------|----------|
| DNS Management Tracking | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | 100% |
| Hosted Zone Validation | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | 100% |
